# Flight Booking System Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Price Consistency Fix

**Problem**: The payment price did not match the search result price because the selected flight's price was not passed through the booking flow.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ListFlights` component to include the selected flight's price in the user message
- Modified `generateReservationPrice` function to accept and use the selected flight's price
- Updated the `createReservation` tool to extract and pass the selected flight price
- Enhanced the AI system prompt to extract and remember the selected flight's price

**Files Modified**:
- `components/flights/list-flights.tsx` - Pass price in user selection
- `ai/actions.ts` - Accept selected flight price parameter
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Extract and use selected flight price

### 2. Seat Map UI Improvements

**Problem**: The seat map was not visually appealing, well-structured, or class-aware.

**Solution**:
- Completely refactored `SelectSeats` component with class-based organization
- Added class selector buttons (First Class, Business Class, Economy Class)
- Implemented color-coded seats by class (Purple for First, Blue for Business, Green for Economy)
- Improved visual layout with better spacing, borders, and hover effects
- Added seat availability counter and better legends
- Updated seat generation to create class-aware data with appropriate pricing

**Files Modified**:
- `components/flights/select-seats.tsx` - Complete UI overhaul
- `ai/actions.ts` - Generate class-aware seat data

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

**Features Added**:
- **Price Consistency**: Selected flight price is now maintained throughout the booking flow
- **Class Selection**: Users can switch between different seat classes
- **Visual Improvements**: Better color coding, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- **Availability Display**: Shows number of available seats per class
- **Responsive Design**: Improved mobile and desktop experience

### 4. Data Structure Improvements

**Seat Data Structure**:
- Added `class` property to seat objects
- Implemented class-based pricing tiers
- Better organization of seats by class and row

**Pricing Structure**:
- First Class: $120-180 (rows 1-2)
- Business Class: $80-120 (rows 3-5)  
- Economy Class: $30-60 (rows 6-10)

### 5. Fallback Mechanisms

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful fallback to sample data when real data is unavailable
- Clear user feedback about using sample data
- Robust error handling in seat generation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Price Consistency Test**:
   - Search for flights and note the price
   - Select a flight and proceed through booking
   - Verify the payment price matches the search result price

2. **Seat Map Test**:
   - Test switching between different seat classes
   - Verify color coding and visual improvements
   - Test seat selection functionality
   - Check responsive design on mobile devices

3. **Error Handling Test**:
   - Test behavior when Amadeus API is unavailable
   - Verify fallback to sample data works correctly

## Next Steps

The system now provides:
- ✅ Consistent pricing throughout the booking flow
- ✅ Class-aware seat selection with improved UI
- ✅ Better user experience and visual design
- ✅ Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

Users should now see the exact same price from search to payment, and have a much better experience selecting seats with the new class-based interface.
